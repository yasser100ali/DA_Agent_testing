Correlation with Points (PTS)\n- **Usage Percentage (USG Pct):** Highest correlation with high scoring at **0.80**, indicating a very strong positive relationship.\n- **True Shooting Percentage (TS Pct):** Moderate correlation of **0.28**.\n- **Assists (AST):** Moderate correlation of **0.28**.\n- **Assist Percentage (AST Pct):** Moderate correlation of **0.27**.\n- All other features showed lower correlations (below 0.21).\n\n#### 2. Feature Importance (Predictive Modeling)\n- **USG Pct:** Features as the most important predictor, with an **importance score of 0.70** (over six times more important than the next feature).\n- **TS Pct:** Next highest at **0.11**.\n- **REB and GP:** Each only about **0.03**.\n- **AST:** Feature importance of **0.02**.\n\n#### 3. Regression Coefficients and Significance\n- All features except for Net Rating (**-0.03**) and to a lesser extent Player Height (**-0.014**) have either positive, significant coefficients or small negatives.\n- **USG Pct:** Large, positive, and highly significant coefficient (**95.85**, p < 0.001).\n- **TS Pct:** Large, positive, significant (**30.15**, p < 0.001).\n- **AST and REB:** Smaller but positive and significant coefficients (**1.94** and **1.60**, both p < 0.001).\n- **AST Pct, DREB Pct, OREB Pct:** Significant negative coefficients, but less impactful compared to usage and true shooting.\n- **GP (Games Played):** Minimal, positive effect (**0.012**).\n\n#### 4.

Key Rankings & Justification\n\n- **Points (PTS)**:\n    - By far the largest contributor according to feature importance (68%).\n    - Shows the highest correlation with impact score at 0.87.\n- **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**:\n    - Strong secondary importance (18%) and robust correlation both with impact score (0.70) and with points (0.80).\n    - Most significant non-point metric.\n- **Assists (AST) & True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)**:\n    - Moderate correlation with impact score (AST: 0.44).\n    - Lower feature importance individually (AST: 0.03, TS PCT: 0.02), but both show statistically significant relationships with points and contribute contextually to player efficiency and playmaking.\n- Other features like **Defensive Rebounds**, **Net Rating**, and **AST PCT** all contribute less than 1% to overall feature importance and are statistically significant but not strong determinants.\n\n### 3. Regression Analysis (with respect to Points)\n\n- **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**, **True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)**, **Assists (AST)**, and **Assist Percentage (AST PCT)** are all statistically significant (p < 0.001), reinforcing that team involvement and efficiency have measurable, though lesser, impacts on player impact.\n- Regression coefficients further reinforce the outsized importance of usage and efficiency metrics but emphasize that nothing rivals the individual impact of scoring volume.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table of Most Important Features\n\n|  Rank  | Feature Name     | Feature Description                  | Importance (%) | Correlation with Impact Score |\n|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|\n|   1    | **Points (PTS)**         | Volume of points scored             | 68.2           | 0.87                         |\n|   2    | **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**| Player’s share of team possessions| 18.1           | 0.70                         |\n|   3    | **Assists (AST)**        | Total assists                       | 2.8            | 0.44                         |\n|   4    | **True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)**| Scoring efficiency including 3PT & FT | 2.2            | —                            |\n|   5    | **Rebounds (REB)**       | Total rebounds                      | 2.2            | 0.50                         |\n\n---\n\nThe statistical evidence provides clear backing that **Points (PTS)**, followed by **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**, are the principal features for determining player impact. Secondary factors such as **Assists (AST)** and **True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)** provide additional but comparatively modest contributions to determining impactful players."
