Date: 05_27_2025_Tuesday, Role: assistant, Content: # Report: Best Indicators of High Scoring in Basketball  **Claim:**   **Usage Percentage (USG Pct) is the single strongest indicator of high scoring (PTS), with secondary but meaningful contributions from True Shooting Percentage (TS Pct), Assists (AST), and Rebounds (REB) among other features, as shown by their statistical significance, correlation, and feature importance scores.**  ---  ### Evidence and Analysis  #### 1. Correlation with Points (PTS) - **Usage Percentage (USG Pct):** Highest correlation with high scoring at **0.80**, indicating a very strong positive relationship. - **True Shooting Percentage (TS Pct):** Moderate correlation of **0.28**. - **Assists (AST):** Moderate correlation of **0.28**. - **Assist Percentage (AST Pct):** Moderate correlation of **0.27**. - All other features showed lower correlations (below 0.21).  #### 2. Feature Importance (Predictive Modeling) - **USG Pct:** Features as the most important predictor, with an **importance score of 0.70** (over six times more important than the next feature). - **TS Pct:** Next highest at **0.11**. - **REB and GP:** Each only about **0.03**. - **AST:** Feature importance of **0.02**.  #### 3. Regression Coefficients and Significance - All features except for Net Rating (**-0.03**) and to a lesser extent Player Height (**-0.014**) have either positive, significant coefficients or small negatives. - **USG Pct:** Large, positive, and highly significant coefficient (**95.85**, p < 0.001). - **TS Pct:** Large, positive, significant (**30.15**, p < 0.001). - **AST and REB:** Smaller but positive and significant coefficients (**1.94** and **1.60**, both p < 0.001). - **AST Pct, DREB Pct, OREB Pct:** Significant negative coefficients, but less impactful compared to usage and true shooting. - **GP (Games Played):** Minimal, positive effect (**0.012**).  #### 4.

Date: 05_27_2025_Tuesday, Role: user, Content: write report on most important features for determining impactful players
Date: 05_27_2025_Tuesday, Role: assistant, Content: # Report  **Claim:**   The most important feature for determining impactful players is **Points (PTS)**, as it shows the highest correlation (0.87) with impact score and dominates feature importance (68%); secondary significance is found in **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**, with moderate contributions from **Assists (AST)** and **True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)**.  ---  ## Evidence & Analysis  The results across multiple analyses—correlation, feature importance, and regression—consistently point towards a definitive hierarchy in feature impact for player importance:  ### 1. Quantitative Ranking of Feature Impact  | Feature                | Correlation with Impact Score | Feature Importance | Correlation with PTS | |------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------| | **Points (PTS)**           | 0.87                         | 0.68               | —                   | | **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**| 0.70                         | 0.18               | 0.80                | | **Assists (AST)**          | 0.44                         | 0.03               | 0.28                | | **True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)**| Not reported                 | 0.02               | 0.28                | | **Rebounds (REB)**         | 0.50                         | 0.02               | —                   | | **Defensive Rebound Percentage (DREB PCT)**| 0.42                         | 0.008              | —                   | | **Assists Percentage (AST PCT)** | Not reported                 | 0.013              | 0.27                | | **Net Rating (NET RATING)**| Not reported                 | 0.009              | 0.20                | | **Games Played (GP)**      | Not reported                 | 0.008              | —                   | | **Offensive Rebound Percentage (OREB PCT)**| Not reported                 | 0.008              | —                   | | **Age (AGE)**              | Not reported                 | 0.006              | —                   | | **Player Height/Player Weight**| Not reported                 | 0.005–0.009         | —                   |  ### 2. Key Rankings & Justification  - **Points (PTS)**:     - By far the largest contributor according to feature importance (68%).     - Shows the highest correlation with impact score at 0.87. - **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**:     - Strong secondary importance (18%) and robust correlation both with impact score (0.70) and with points (0.80).     - Most significant non-point metric. - **Assists (AST) & True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)**:     - Moderate correlation with impact score (AST: 0.44).     - Lower feature importance individually (AST: 0.03, TS PCT: 0.02), but both show statistically significant relationships with points and contribute contextually to player efficiency and playmaking. - Other features like **Defensive Rebounds**, **Net Rating**, and **AST PCT** all contribute less than 1% to overall feature importance and are statistically significant but not strong determinants.  ### 3. Regression Analysis (with respect to Points)  - **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**, **True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)**, **Assists (AST)**, and **Assist Percentage (AST PCT)** are all statistically significant (p < 0.001), reinforcing that team involvement and efficiency have measurable, though lesser, impacts on player impact. - Regression coefficients further reinforce the outsized importance of usage and efficiency metrics but emphasize that nothing rivals the individual impact of scoring volume.  ---  ### Summary Table of Most Important Features  |  Rank  | Feature Name     | Feature Description                  | Importance (%) | Correlation with Impact Score | |--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------| |   1    | **Points (PTS)**         | Volume of points scored             | 68.2           | 0.87                         | |   2    | **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**| Player’s share of team possessions| 18.1           | 0.70                         | |   3    | **Assists (AST)**        | Total assists                       | 2.8            | 0.44                         | |   4    | **True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)**| Scoring efficiency including 3PT & FT | 2.2            | —                            | |   5    | **Rebounds (REB)**       | Total rebounds                      | 2.2            | 0.50                         |  ---  The statistical evidence provides clear backing that **Points (PTS)**, followed by **Usage Percentage (USG PCT)**, are the principal features for determining player impact. Secondary factors such as **Assists (AST)** and **True Shooting Percentage (TS PCT)** provide additional but comparatively modest contributions to determining impactful players.

Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: assistant, Content: From yesterday's conversation (Tuesday, May 27th), the most important factors for determining high scoring in basketball were:  1. **Usage Percentage (USG Pct):**    - Identified as the single strongest indicator of high scoring.     - Highest correlation with points scored (correlation = 0.803).    - Dominated feature importance and had a large, significant regression coefficient.  2. **True Shooting Percentage (TS Pct):**    - Moderate but meaningful correlation with points (correlation = 0.28).    - Second highest in predictive importance.  3. **Assists (AST) and Rebounds (REB):**    - Both had positive, statistically significant contributions.    - AST correlation with points was 0.28, with smaller but significant feature importance.  **Summary of key evidence from yesterday:**   Usage Percentage (USG Pct) is by far the best predictor of high scoring, supported to a lesser extent by True Shooting Percentage, Assists, and Rebounds.

Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: user, Content: what was yesterday's ocnversation about? summarize briefly
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: assistant, Content: Yesterday's conversation (05_27_2025_Tuesday) was about basketball analytics and a database query:  - The user asked for reports on the best indicators of high scoring in basketball (finding Usage Percentage (USG Pct) as the top indicator) and on the most important features for determining impactful players (Points (PTS) was most important, followed by USG Pct). - There were questions about correlation between usage and points, and the assistant provided correlation values. - The user requested a list of employees from an SQL database, and the assistant returned a table of employees and their details.  In summary: The discussion yesterday focused on basketball analytics (key metrics for scoring and player impact), feature importance analysis, and retrieving a company employee list from a database.
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: user, Content: from yesterday's conversation, what was the correlation between usage pct and pts?
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: assistant, Content: From yesterday's conversation (05_27_2025_Tuesday), the correlation between Usage Percentage (USG Pct) and Points (PTS) was reported as:  USG_PCT vs PTS: 0.803311  This indicates a very strong positive relationship between usage percentage and points scored.
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: user, Content: from yesterday's conversation, what were the most important factors for determining high scoring
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: assistant, Content: From yesterday's conversation (Tuesday, May 27th), the most important factors for determining high scoring in basketball were:  1. **Usage Percentage (USG Pct):**    - Identified as the single strongest indicator of high scoring.     - Highest correlation with points scored (correlation = 0.803).    - Dominated feature importance and had a large, significant regression coefficient.  2. **True Shooting Percentage (TS Pct):**    - Moderate but meaningful correlation with points (correlation = 0.28).    - Second highest in predictive importance.  3. **Assists (AST) and Rebounds (REB):**    - Both had positive, statistically significant contributions.    - AST correlation with points was 0.28, with smaller but significant feature importance.  **Summary of key evidence from yesterday:**   Usage Percentage (USG Pct) is by far the best predictor of high scoring, supported to a lesser extent by True Shooting Percentage, Assists, and Rebounds. Other features contributed much less or had negative effects.   If you want a detailed table or further breakdown, let me know!

Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: user, Content: write a report on the best selling albums and artists
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: assistant, Content: # Report  **Claim:** The best-selling artist is Iron Maiden, while the best-selling album is "Minha Historia" by Chico Buarque, based on total reported sales.  ## Main Findings  - **Best-Selling Artists:**     - The artist with the highest total sales is **Iron Maiden** with sales of **140 units** in one dataset and **138.60 units** in another, clearly leading both rankings.     - Following Iron Maiden are **U2** (**107** and **105.93** units), **Metallica** (**91** and **90.09** units), and **Led Zeppelin** (**87** and **86.13** units). - **Best-Selling Albums:**     - The album with the highest recorded sales is **"Minha Historia"** by **Chico Buarque** with **27** units (appearing as 26.73 in another dataset).     - Next are **"Greatest Hits"** by **Lenny Kravitz** (**26** units), **"Unplugged"** by **Eric Clapton** (**25** units), and **"Acústico"** by **Titãs** (**22** units).  ## Supporting Table  | Rank | Artist Name        | Total Sales | Best-Selling Album      | Album Sales | |------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------| | 1    | **Iron Maiden**   | 140         | -                       | -           | | 2    | **U2**            | 107         | -                       | -           | | 3    | **Metallica**     | 91          | -                       | -           | | 4    | **Led Zeppelin**  | 87          | -                       | -           | |      |                   |             | **Minha Historia**      | 27          | |      |                   |             | Greatest Hits (Kravitz) | 26          | |      |                   |             | Unplugged (Clapton)     | 25          | |      |                   |             | Acústico (Titãs)        | 22          |   ## Additional Notes  - The difference between artist-level and album-level sales is significant: top-selling artists have much higher aggregate sales than individual albums, suggesting robust discographies. - There is consistency across both datasets regarding the top-selling artists and albums, bolstering the credibility of these rankings. - **Regression results indicate the number of albums an artist releases is not a statistically significant predictor (p=0.191) of sales (R-squared = 0.005),** underscoring that sales volume depends on other factors beyond mere productivity.  ## Key Feature Name Translations  - **Total Sales**: Total sales per artist or album. - **Artist Name**: Name of the artist or band. - **Album Sales**: Sales attributed to a particular album. - **AlbumID/Title**: Unique identifier and title for each album.  **Summary:** The data robustly supports Iron Maiden as the top-selling artist and "Minha Historia" as the top-selling album, with strong supporting numerical evidence.

Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: assistant, Content: # Report  **Claim:** The best-selling artist is Iron Maiden, while the best-selling album is "Minha Historia" by Chico Buarque, based on total reported sales.  ## Main Findings  - **Best-Selling Artists:**     - The artist with the highest total sales is **Iron Maiden** with sales of **140 units** in one dataset and **138.60 units** in another, clearly leading both rankings.     - Following Iron Maiden are **U2** (**107** and **105.93** units), **Metallica** (**91** and **90.09** units), and **Led Zeppelin** (**87** and **86.13** units). - **Best-Selling Albums:**     - The album with the highest recorded sales is **"Minha Historia"** by **Chico Buarque** with **27** units (appearing as 26.73 in another dataset).     - Next are **"Greatest Hits"** by **Lenny Kravitz** (**26** units), **"Unplugged"** by **Eric Clapton** (**25** units), and **"Acústico"** by **Titãs** (**22** units).  ## Supporting Table  | Rank | Artist Name        | Total Sales | Best-Selling Album      | Album Sales | |------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------| | 1    | **Iron Maiden**   | 140         | -                       | -           | | 2    | **U2**            | 107         | -                       | -           | | 3    | **Metallica**     | 91          | -                       | -           | | 4    | **Led Zeppelin**  | 87          | -                       | -           | |      |                   |             | **Minha Historia**      | 27          | |      |                   |             | Greatest Hits (Kravitz) | 26          | |      |                   |             | Unplugged (Clapton)     | 25          | |      |                   |             | Acústico (Titãs)        | 22          |   ## Additional Notes  - The difference between artist-level and album-level sales is significant: top-selling artists have much higher aggregate sales than individual albums, suggesting robust discographies. - There is consistency across both datasets regarding the top-selling artists and albums, bolstering the credibility of these rankings. - **Regression results indicate the number of albums an artist releases is not a statistically significant predictor (p=0.191) of sales (R-squared = 0.005),** underscoring that sales volume depends on other factors beyond mere productivity.  ## Key Feature Name Translations  - **Total Sales**: Total sales per artist or album. - **Artist Name**: Name of the artist or band. - **Album Sales**: Sales attributed to a particular album. - **AlbumID/Title**: Unique identifier and title for each album.  **Summary:** The data robustly supports Iron Maiden as the top-selling artist and "Minha Historia" as the top-selling album, with strong supporting numerical evidence.

Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: user, Content: summarize yesterday's conversation
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: assistant, Content: Here’s a brief summary of yesterday’s conversation (Tuesday, May 27th):  - The discussion focused on basketball analytics. The user requested reports analyzing:     - The best indicators of high scoring in basketball (finding Usage Percentage (USG Pct) as the top indicator, supported by True Shooting Percentage, Assists, and Rebounds).     - The most important features for determining impactful players (Points (PTS) ranked highest, followed by Usage Percentage). - Specific correlations, such as between Usage Percentage and Points (correlation = 0.803), were provided. - The user also asked for, and received, a list of company employees from an SQL database.  In summary: Yesterday’s conversation centered on key basketball metrics and their statistical importance, plus retrieving an employee list from the database.
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: user, Content: that's great now what are the most important features that impact scoring that you found from yesterday?
Date: 05_28_2025_Wednesday, Role: assistant, Content: Here’s a concise summary of the most important features that impact scoring, based on the findings from yesterday's conversation (Tuesday, May 27th):  1. **Usage Percentage (USG Pct)**      - This is the single strongest indicator of high scoring.    - Highest correlation with points scored (correlation = 0.803).    - Had the largest feature importance (importance score = 0.70) and the most significant regression coefficient.  2. **True Shooting Percentage (TS Pct)**    - Second in importance.    - Moderate correlation with points (correlation = 0.28).    - Predictive importance is notable but much less than USG Pct.  3. **Assists (AST)**    - Also positively impacts scoring.    - Correlation with points is 0.28, with a smaller but statistically significant contribution.  4. **Rebounds (REB)**    - Positive and significant but less impactful compared to the above features.  **Summary:**   - Usage Percentage (USG Pct) is by far the best predictor of high scoring. - True Shooting Percentage (TS Pct), Assists, and Rebounds provide meaningful but lesser contributions. - Other statistical features were either much less important or had negative/insignificant relationships.

Date: 05_29_2025_Thursday, Role: assistant, Content: # Report: Best NBA Players of All Time  **Claim:**   Based on a comprehensive analysis of scoring, longevity, playmaking, rebounding, and impact metrics, the best NBA players of all time—as indicated by advanced statistics—include LeBron James, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, and Stephen Curry, with LeBron James demonstrating the most consistent overall excellence across all key areas.  ---  ## Evidence and Analysis  ### 1. Cumulative and Per-Game Production  - **LeBron James** leads in both **Games Played (1,421)** and **Total Points (544.0)** among the considered top players, indicating exceptional longevity and production. - **Kobe Bryant** and **Dirk Nowitzki** also rank high in career stats, with over 1,200 games each, underpinning sustained excellence. - **Luka Doncic** has the highest **Points Per Game (27.7)**, followed closely by **Kevin Durant (27.2)** and **LeBron James (27.2)**, highlighting their elite scoring abilities.  ### 2. Advanced Impact Metrics  - **Impact Score** (composite metric for overall contribution) places:     - **Luka Doncic (13.69)** at the top,     - followed by **James Harden (12.06)**, **Giannis Antetokounmpo (11.98)**, **LeBron James (11.96)**, **Joel Embiid (11.14)**, **Nikola Jokic (11.08)**, **Trae Young (10.27)**, **Kevin Durant (9.12)**, and **Stephen Curry (9.00)**. - **Distribution stats** show that an **Impact Score above 11** places a player in the highest echelon (mean: 9.03, median: 8.32).  #### Table: Top-10 NBA Players by Impact Score  | Player                | Impact Score | Games Played | Points/Game | Total Points | |-----------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------------| | Luka Doncic           | 13.69        | n/a          | 27.7        | n/a          | | James Harden          | 12.06        | n/a          | 26.8        | n/a          | | Giannis Antetokounmpo | 11.98        | n/a          | n/a         | n/a          | | LeBron James          | 11.96        | 1,421        | 27.2        | 544.0        | | Joel Embiid           | 11.14        | n/a          | n/a         | n/a          | | Nikola Jokic          | 11.08        | n/a          | n/a         | n/a          | | Trae Young            | 10.27        | n/a          | n/a         | n/a          | | Kevin Durant          | 9.12         | n/a          | 27.23       | 408.5        | | Stephen Curry         | 9.00         | n/a          | n/a         | n/a          | | Russell Westbrook     | 8.76         | n/a          | n/a         | n/a          |  ### 3. Playmaking & Efficiency  - **LeBron James** is also near the top in **Total Assists (146.8)**, only behind **Chris Paul (150.4)**. - **Chris Paul** has the top **Assist Percentage (0.4298)**—a critical feature for all-time playmaking impact. - Regarding efficiency, **True Shooting Percentage** leaders are role players, but top stars (e.g., **Kevin Durant** at 0.529, **LeBron James** consistently above league average) excel among high-usage volume shooters.  ### 4. Rebounding & Defensive Impact  - **Tim Duncan (179.3)** and **Kevin Garnett (155.5)** lead cumulative rebounding, but **LeBron James** remains notable (150.8), underlining his all-around impact. - Impact Score and **Net Rating** also favor versatile stars: **LeBron James** and **Giannis Antetokounmpo** appear with high values, indicating strong team influence when on the court.  ### 5. Comparison of Scorers vs. Impact Players  - A statistical t-test comparing the "top points per game" group (mean: 33.26) and "top impact" group (mean: 27.84) confirms a significant difference (t-stat: 3.39, df: 10.72), but there is heavy overlap: **James Harden, LeBron James, Stephen Curry** regularly appear in both groups.  ### 6. Other Noted Legends  - Historic figures such as **Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Grant Hill, Clyde Drexler** (from the 1996-97 season breakdown) and **Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan** (from cumulative stats) also rank among the best for different eras, supporting the modern data-driven lists.  ---  **Key Feature Highlights (bold = feature):**  - **Games Played**: LeBron James (1,421, all-time leader among listed). - **Points Per Game**: Luka Doncic (27.7), Kevin Durant (27.2), LeBron James (27.2). - **Impact Score**: Luka Doncic (13.69), James Harden (12.06), LeBron James (11.96). - **Total Assists**: Chris Paul (150.4), LeBron James (146.8). - **Rebounds**: Tim Duncan (179.3 total), LeBron James (150.8). - **Net Rating**: LeBron James consistently high among contemporary peers.  ---  **Summary of Evidence:**   Combined measures of longevity, scoring, playmaking, rebounding, and advanced impact analytics consistently support LeBron James as the most well-rounded all-time great, while James Harden, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, and Stephen Curry are among the best across modern NBA history and stand out statistically within the data.

Other Noted Legends  - Historic figures such as **Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Grant Hill, Clyde Drexler** (from the 1996-97 season breakdown) and **Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan** (from cumulative stats) also rank among the best for different eras, supporting the modern data-driven lists.  ---  **Key Feature Highlights (bold = feature):**  - **Games Played**: LeBron James (1,421, all-time leader among listed). - **Points Per Game**: Luka Doncic (27.7), Kevin Durant (27.2), LeBron James (27.2). - **Impact Score**: Luka Doncic (13.69), James Harden (12.06), LeBron James (11.96). - **Total Assists**: Chris Paul (150.4), LeBron James (146.8). - **Rebounds**: Tim Duncan (179.3 total), LeBron James (150.8). - **Net Rating**: LeBron James consistently high among contemporary peers.  ---  **Summary of Evidence:**   Combined measures of longevity, scoring, playmaking, rebounding, and advanced impact analytics consistently support LeBron James as the most well-rounded all-time great, while James Harden, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, and Stephen Curry are among the best across modern NBA history and stand out statistically within the data.

Date: 05_29_2025_Thursday, Role: assistant, Content: # Report: Best Rebounders of All Time  **Claim:**   Tim Duncan is the most dominant rebounder among the top NBA players analyzed, supported by his significantly higher total rebounds metric (179.3) compared to his peers, though statistical correlation suggests that raw rebound numbers alone do not strongly predict Hall of Fame induction.  ---  ## Evidence Supporting the Claim  ### Top Career Rebounders (Total Rebounds) Analysis of historical player performance data reveals the following rankings among elite rebounders based on total rebounds (**REB**):  | Player Name         | Total Rebounds (REB) | |---------------------|---------------------| | Tim Duncan          | **179.3**           | | Kevin Garnett       | 155.5               | | LeBron James        | 150.8               | | Dwight Howard       | 142.2               | | Dirk Nowitzki       | 135.6               | | Pau Gasol           | 133.8               | | Shaquille O'Neal    | 129.6               | | Zach Randolph       | 122.1               | | Kevin Love          | 115.7               | | LaMarcus Aldridge   | 111.2               |  - **Tim Duncan** leads with **179.3** total rebounds, exceeding the second-best performer, Kevin Garnett, by a substantial margin of 23.8 rebounds. - Notably, players such as LeBron James (150.8), Dwight Howard (142.2), and Shaquille O'Neal (129.6) also stand out as historically significant rebounders.  ### Season and Per-Game Leaders  Average rebounds per game (**RPG**) in select seasons identify Raiquan Gray (9.0), Elijah Bryant (6.0), and Louis King (4.0) as strong performers, but their single-season achievements do not match the career dominance seen in the table above.  ### Correlation to Hall of Fame Entry  - The calculated correlation of **career RPG** and **total rebounds** with Hall of Fame induction is very low—approximately **-0.007** for both metrics—demonstrating that exceptional rebounding alone is not a strong predictor for Hall of Fame status. - This suggests that while rebounding is a valuable individual achievement, Hall of Fame selection typically considers broader factors beyond just statistical dominance in this area.  ---  ## Key Features  - **Total Rebounds (REB):** Total rebounds accumulated, used for career achievement assessment. - **Rebounds Per Game (RPG):** Average rebounds per game, reflecting season or game-level performance.  ---  ### Summary Table: Top Career Rebounders  | Player Name         | Total Rebounds (REB) | |---------------------|---------------------| | Tim Duncan          | **179.3**           | | Kevin Garnett       | 155.5               | | LeBron James        | 150.8               | | Dwight Howard       | 142.2               | | Dirk Nowitzki       | 135.6               | | Pau Gasol           | 133.8               | | Shaquille O'Neal    | 129.6               | | Zach Randolph       | 122.1               | | Kevin Love          | 115.7               | | LaMarcus Aldridge   | 111.2               |  ---  ## Additional Notes  - Rebound data includes both cumulative career totals and per-game averages, providing a balanced picture of both longevity and dominance in rebound gathering. - Players' historical averages in **Rebounds Per Game** can highlight single-season or short-term achievements but are less indicative of all-time greatness compared to total career rebounds.
